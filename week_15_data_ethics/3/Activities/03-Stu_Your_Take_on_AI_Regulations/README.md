# Your Take on AI Regulations

In this activity, you’ll have an opportunity to reflect on your personal feelings about AI regulations.

## Background

As new technology emerges, new ethical concerns and issues also arise. We’ve already discussed the following issues:

* AI systems can harm large numbers of people before issues are detected, and there are cases where issues may never be detected.

* AI ethics sits at the cross section between philosophy and ethics and technology.

* Researchers need to analyze and audit AI systems in order to determine harmful impacts to people and society.

* Researchers must come up with technical solutions for these problems.

As you can see from this list and everything you’ve learned so far, establishing and maintaining up-to-date regulations around AI will be critical to establish and maintain updated AI regulations to benefit society.

## Instructions

1. Reflect on what you’ve learned so far about AI regulation, and answer the following questions:

* What concerns do you have about how AI systems could impact you? 

* Do you believe that governments will be able to effectively regulate AI? 

* Do you trust tech companies to regulate themselves? 

* How might the introduction of regulation impact innovation in AI?

## Hints

* Ethical questions, like the ones here, often exist in shades of gray. After determining your initial stance, challenge yourself with the opposite viewpoint.

* If you’re feeling stuck, consider searching Google News to find articles about the topics mentioned earlier.

**Remember:** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
