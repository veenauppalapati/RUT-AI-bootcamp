# Columns

In this activity, you will take a pre-made DataFrame of charity donations and reorganize it so that it is easier to understand.

## Instructions

* Import the CSV file from the Resources folder.

* Note that the column names are inconsistent and difficult to work with. Rename them to the following:

    * "Donor", "Employer”, "City”, "State”, "Zip Code", and "Donation Amount".

Create a new table that contains these columns in the following order:

* "Donor", "Donation Amount", "Employer”, and "City”.
